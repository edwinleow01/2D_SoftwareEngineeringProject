Collaborative 2D Game Engine + Game Project built by Developers and UI/UX Engineers

# 🛠️ Unnamed Studio Engine
Unnamed Studio Engine is a versatile 2D game engine designed to support a wide range of game genres. 
Built with scalability in mind, it leverages an Entity Component System (ECS) architecture to enable modular, flexible, and reusable development workflows.

This project is developed by a team of eight Year 2 Computer Science and UI/UX students from the Singapore Institute of Technology, in Joint Degree with DigiPen Institute of Technology.

The engine is written in C++, utilizing OpenGL and GLSL for graphics rendering. 
These technologies empower the team to apply object-oriented design principles and maintain clean, maintainable code. 
Our primary goal is to create a scalable engine and editor that promotes efficient game development through a robust ECS-based structure.

## 🚀 Engine Features
- 🧱 Entity-Component System (ECS)
- 🧩 Entity Property (Translation, Rotation, Textures, Scale etc.)
- 🗂️ File Management System (Serialization/Deserialization, Save/Load, File I/O Utilities, Asset Loading/Organization)
- 🖱️ Drag & Drop files (eg., .png, .jpg, .mp3, .wav, .ogg etc.)
- 🖼️ Sprite Rendering and Animation
- ⌨️ Keyboard Input
- 🎵 Sound/Music Playback
- 🎬 Scene Management

## ▶️ To Run Engine/Game
Unzip the file, and run
- x64/Release/Engine.exe      - 🧪 Engine Showcase
- x64/Release/Corvaders.exe   - 🎮 Gameplay Showcase

## ⚠️ Important Notes
The game engine starts in a paused state, and no entities will appear in the viewport initially.
To begin simulation, click on "Play" on the top panel.

Unnamed Studio Engine is feature-complete and stable. However, as with any complex software, minor bugs or edge cases may still exist.
